'''
A function that crossmatches two catalogues within a maximum distance. It should return a list of 
matches and non-matches for the first catalogue against the second.

The list of matches contains tuples of the first and second catalogue object IDs and their distance. 
The list of non-matches contains the unmatched object IDs from the first catalogue only. Both lists 
should be ordered by the first catalogue's IDs.

All conversions to radians are carried out before any crossmatching occures.

The angular distance between two objects is defined as the angle between the two object's positions 
on the celestial sphere.
